# python-api-challenge

Hello! This is my submission for the Module 6: Python API challenge with Rice University's Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp. In this assignment, we used API keys from Open Weather Map and GeoApify to analyze data from certain cities and construct informative maps and graphs. 

In the first part of the challenge using the Open Weather Map API, we called information from approximately 500-600 cities in the database, and constructed graphs to observe the relationships between Latitude, Humidity, Cloudiness, Temperature, and Wind Speed. The analyses of these graphs are contained WITHIN THE FILE ITSELF.

In part two, using the GeoApify key and the dataframe created in part one, we populated two maps: one using Latitude and Longitude to find the cities with the highest humidity levels, and the second to find cities in a given temperature range and their proximity to hotels. 

This code was written in VS Code Jupyter Notebooks. For best results, the code should also be run in VS Code or in a Jupyter Notebooks browser.

The work contained herein is mine and mine alone.

Thanks!
